    <p id="snes-p1">
        To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and
        Sega followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989
        as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and
        offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to
        become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when
        they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.

    <h2 id="snes-console">The Console Wars</h2>
    <p id="snes-p3">
        The rivalry between Nintendo and Sega resulted in what has been described as one of the most notable console
        wars in video game history, in which Sega positioned the Genesis as the "cool" console, with games aimed
        at older audiences, and aggressive advertisements that occasionally attacked the competition. Nintendo,
        however, scored an early public-relations advantage by securing the first console conversion of Capcom's arcade
        hit Street Fighter II for SNES, which took more than a year to make the transition to the Genesis. Though the
        Genesis had a two-year lead to launch time, a much larger library of games, and a lower price point, it only
        represented an estimated 60% of the American 16-bit console market in June 1992, and neither console could
        maintain a definitive lead for several years. Donkey Kong Country is said to have helped establish the SNES's
        market prominence in the latter years of the 16-bit generation, and for a time, maintain against the PlayStation
        and Saturn. According to Nintendo, the company had sold more than 20 million SNES units in the U.S. According to
        a 2014 Wedbush Securities report based on NPD sales data, the SNES outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market.
