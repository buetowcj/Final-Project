        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a
            cartridge-based console called the Family Computer, or Famicom. Masayuki Uemura (ja) designed the system.
            Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with
            a keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead decided
            to go for a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he believed that features such as
            keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in October 1982
            to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs
            had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and
            it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001
            computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for
            this purpose existed at that time.

        <h2>Accessories</h2>
        <p>
            The game controller used for both the NES and the Famicom features an oblong brick-like design with a simple
            four button layout: two round buttons labeled "A" and "B", a "START" button, and a "SELECT" button.
            Additionally, the controllers utilize the cross-shaped joypad, designed by Nintendo employee Gunpei Yokoi
            for Nintendo Game & Watch systems, to replace the bulkier joysticks on earlier gaming consoles' controllers.
            <br> <br>
            The original model Famicom features two game controllers, both of which are hardwired to the back of the
            console. The second controller lacks the START and SELECT buttons, but features a small microphone. Relatively
            few games use this feature. The earliest produced Famicom units have square A and B buttons. This was changed
            to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when pressed
            down and glitches within the hardware causing the system to freeze occasionally while playing a game.
